# Citadel PhD Datathon Fall 2023
This was a highly selective individual datathon where in the span of 5 days we had to answer the problem statement (confidential) and present our work in a [report](https://github.com/lukablagoje/datathon-report).

# Research Project Overview
This project extends the research work "Unveiling Clickbait: A Dive into Sentiments, Emotions, and Topics" by Luka Blagojevic, focusing on the analysis of clickbait articles in online media. The research aims to understand the textual properties of clickbait and how they influence user engagement.

The original study employed Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze sentiments, emotions, and topics within clickbait articles. My contribution includes further analysis on how these properties affect user engagement on a more granular level, using advanced statistical methods and machine learning algorithms.

# Technical Project Overview
My technical work on this project is divided into four main parts:

1. **Google Analytics Analysis**: Leveraging Google Analytics, I extracted and analyzed user engagement metrics. This involved studying user behavior patterns, click-through rates, and other relevant metrics to understand how users interact with clickbait content. The notebook [`google_analytics_analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/lukablagoje/google-analytics-analysis) details this process.

2. **Data Cleaning, Processing and Exploratory Data Analysis**: I refined the dataset used in the original study, focusing on cleaning, categorizing, and preparing the data for deeper analysis. The notebook [`data_cleaning_processing_eda.ipynb`](https://github.com/lukablagoje/data-cleaning-processing-eda) contains the entire process.

3. **NLP Classification**: Here, I developed algorithms for classifying the text of clickbait articles. This part involves sentiment analysis, emotion detection, and topic categorization, as seen in [`nlp_text_classyfing_algorithms.ipynb`](https://github.com/lukablagoje/nlp-text-classyfing-algorithms).

4. **Statistical Rank Analysis, Null Models and Insights**: This section involves applying statistical models to the processed data to glean insights into user engagement. The Jupyter notebook [`google_analytics_analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/lukablagoje/google-analytics-analysis) outlines this analysis.
